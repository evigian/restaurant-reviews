## About

This is the 6th project for the Google Frond-End Developers Nanodegree at Udacity. The starter code for the project was provided by Udacity and it was cloned from this repository https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1.

# Building the project

In order to build this project I used Google Maps with a Google Maps API key and for this reason it was necessary to use the google-maps branch of the starter code.
