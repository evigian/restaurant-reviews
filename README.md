## About

This is the 6th project for the Google Frond-End Developers Nanodegree at Udacity. The starter code for the project was provided by Udacity and it was cloned from this repository https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1.

## Building the project

In order to build this project I used Google Maps with a Google Maps API key and for this reason it was necessary to use the google-maps branch of the starter code. The purpose of this project was to implement our knowledge about responsive design, accessibility and off-line access using service workers.

## How to run the app

You can see the live page of the project here: https://evigian.github.io/restaurant-reviews/.
An alternative option is to run the app locally by using a simple http server. In order to run the app locally, follow the instructions that are given in the original repository of the project [here]: https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1#what-do-i-do-from-here). In this case it is necessary to change the paths in the same way they exist in the starter code, as they were edited in order to work on the live page.

## Acknowledgements

A great thank you to the wonderful Udacity community for their continuous support!
